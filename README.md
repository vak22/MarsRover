# MarsRover
Mars Rover Technical Challenge

The next Mars Rover is being developed, and we need you to come up with a simple way of
issuing navigation instructions to it from back on Earth!

We would like you to model the following.

Part 1: Basic Movement
1. The Mars Rover operates on a grid of arbitrary size.
2. You can only issue three commands: Move forward, rotate clockwise, and rotate
anticlockwise.
3. If the rover moves off the grid, it reappears on the opposite side of the grid.

Part 2: Autopilot
1. Devise a simple process for determining the shortest possible path from one position
on the grid to another.
2. Improve the solution so that it can avoid mountain ranges that occupy a number of
inconvenient grid squares scattered around the map.

Part 3: Putting it all together
1. Output all the instructions and moves carried out by the rover to get from one grid square to
another. The output can take any form e.g rows of text, JSON data, or something graphical.
